# When to Mock

Mock at **system boundaries** only:

- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Databases (sometimes - prefer test DB)
- Time/randomness
- File system (sometimes)

Don't mock:

- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

## Designing for Mockability

At system boundaries, design interfaces that are easy to mock:

**1. Use dependency injection**

Pass external dependencies in rather than creating them internally:

```python
# Easy to mock
def process_payment(order, payment_client):
    return payment_client.charge(order.total)

# Hard to mock
def process_payment(order):
    client = StripeClient(os.environ["STRIPE_KEY"])
    return client.charge(order.total)
```

**2. Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers**

Create specific functions for each external operation instead of one generic function with conditional logic:

```python
# GOOD: each method is independently mockable
class OrdersApi(Protocol):
    def get_user(self, user_id: UserId) -> User: ...
    def get_orders(self, user_id: UserId) -> list[Order]: ...
    def create_order(self, order: NewOrder) -> Order: ...

# BAD: mocking requires conditional logic inside the mock
class OrdersApi(Protocol):
    def request(self, endpoint: str, **options: Any) -> Response: ...
```

The SDK approach means:

- Each mock returns one specific shape
- No conditional logic in test setup
- Easier to see which endpoints a test exercises
- Type safety per endpoint
